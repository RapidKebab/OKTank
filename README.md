# OKTank
Physics-based Unity3D Tank Controller inspired off FRC robots driven with two joysticks. Made to be a realistic simulation of driving a tank both in terms of physics and controls.

This is old Code that I've now open-sourced, it's provided as-is and not supported. Would appreciate being credited if you use it for a purpose.

Controls: You have two schemes:
- Tank Drive: Each track is controlled by an individual axis for maximum control and realism.
- WASD: Controlled by the standard Vertical and Horizontal axes in Unity.

OKTank provides the driving physics for a tank using WheelColliders, and a good example setup. It's portable as long as you use WASD, will take a setup to do proper tank drive.
I'd advise messing with Wheel number, location and slip values for different behaviors.
You are not provided anything that helps you simulate the gun or the visual appearance of tracks on an actual tank.
